I have used react to complte the project.

I have converted the csv file to JSON file to read the data in react js 

When I convert csv file, I used "Shapes, x1, y1 ,x2, y2, x3, y3" as header of the csv file

I have created  a react class component called body to dispaly buttons and I used same calss to do my calculations 

the body.jsx file is in the src folder

I used A = (x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y1 – x1y3 – x2y1 – x3y2)/2 to calculate the area of the triangle 

I used A=πr2 to calculate the arae of the circle.

whaen caluculate area first I used an array to store all the araes and the filterd the largest area using Math.max.apply()

I used different functions to calculate each task.

used array.map to get each data from the Json file.

used body.module.css class to do some styles.
